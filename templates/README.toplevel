The subdirectories here each contain a build of the KG-COVID-19 knowledge graph.
The directories are named with a date (ISO 8601 format, YYYYMMDD) according to when
the build was produced. The current/ directory is the most recent build.

See the README in the build directory for a detailed explanation of each file
contained in that directory.
