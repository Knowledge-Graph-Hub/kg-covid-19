The subdirectories here each contain a build of the KG-COVID-19 knowledge graph.
The directories are named with a timestamp (YYYYMMDD) according to when the build
was produced. The current/ directory is the most recent build.

See the README in the build directory for a detailed explanation of each file
contained in that directory.
